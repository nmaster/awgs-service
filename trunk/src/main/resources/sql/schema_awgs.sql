INSERT INTO ITEM VALUES ('AWGS-2012-001','TELLNET Deliverable 2.2 - Social Network Analysis Methods for Lifelong Learning Communities','eTwinning  is a professional development network for European school teachers and has been aimed to promote European teachers collaboration through the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). TeLLNet Work Package 2.2 aims to identify social roles in the learning network on the member level, on the sub-network structures, and on the network level. A dynamic data flow automatically triggers the re-computation of roles and structures over time, based on the previously established data warehouse. Time series analysis is executed on the eTwinning network data to observe the evolution of the teachersâ€™ professional development. We specify this set of analysis methods as learning analytics for future research.  \n\nSocial roles are reflected through social capital which changes over time. In this report, we focus on employment of dynamic social network analysis (SNA) methods to explore eTwinning teachers social capital via various interactions among them. The analysis is carried out on the established data warehouse in TeLLNet Work Package 2.1. Accordingly, the data warehouse has been further improved and refined. We advance the research in two parts with the following questions.  \n\nFirst, what is the social capital of a European teacher in eTwinning? Driven by the idea that teachers collaborate across the borders with the support of an electronic platform eTwinning, we were able to find correlations between social network analysis measures like degree and betweenness centrality as well as the local clustering coefficient, activity statistics about usage of eTwinning, and the quality management of European Schoolnet. Only the combination of these measures gives us indicators for teachersâ€™ attaining social capital. \n\nSecond, how does teachers social capital change along a long term? A series of network centrality measures are computed at different time points from the starting date in 2005 on. We apply time series analysis as a dynamic network analysis method to track teachers professional development patterns. \n\nThis deliverable is the outcome of task 2.2 of Work Package 2 with a focus on social network analysis based on an improved data warehouse. It is advanced on the results and feedback of the deliverable 2.1 report (see document D2.1 - Data management of large-scale lifelong learning data). All data analysis research is conducted on the anonymous data set extracted from the eTwinning network to guarantee eTwinning teachersâ€™ data privacy.','http://merkur/bscw/bscw.cgi/3323577',4,'yiwei@role.dbis.rwth-aachen.de','2012-04-03 14:02:11'),('AWGS-2012-002','Cloud Services for Improved User Experience in Mobile Video Sharing','ideas for ACM MM12 paper','http://merkur/bscw/bscw.cgi/3320375',1,'kovachev@role.dbis.rwth-aachen.de','2012-04-03 13:19:04'),('AWGS-2012-003','Analysis & Visualization of Real-time Social Interactions with MobSOSX','Social interactions on the Web increasingly become real-time and thus enable communication patterns beyond the traditional request-response still predominant in todays Web services. Although many proprietary or customized real-time protocols exist,the open standard XMPP protocol has gained significant traction for social Web applications over the last few years. XMPP protocol transcripts are thus rich information sources for the analysis of social networks and interactions under one single umbrella. In this paper we present MobSOSX, a model and homonymous software system for recording XMPP transcripts and present MobSOS-QV as a toolkit for analyzing, visualizing, and sharing information on different aspects of social interactions of individuals or even whole communities across a federated network of institutions.','http://merkur.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/bscw/bscw.cgi/d3216546/ReKl11.pdf',6,'renzel@role.dbis.rwth-aachen.de','2012-05-04 12:53:55'),('AWGS-2012-004','Todays top RESTful Web services and why they are not RESTful','Since Fieldings seminal contribution on the REST architecture style in 2000, the so-called class of RESTful services has taken off to challenge whole classes of previously existing Web services. Several books have since then emerged, providing a set of valuable guidelines and design principles for the development of truly RESTful services. However, todays most popular RESTful services adopt only very few of these guidelines. In this paper we present an in-depth analysis of the top 25 RESTful services listed on programmableweb.com against 17 RESTful design principles found in literature.
